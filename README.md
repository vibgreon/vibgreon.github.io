Using GitHub Pages to Build, Deploy, and Host Next.js

In this repo we'll

1. enable GitHub pages for a Next.js project's repo
2. set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build, export, and deploy the static site whenever main is pushed
3. adjust Next.js's options to fit with GitHub Actions URL structure
4. and we'll set up a personal Imgix image CDN to support next/image-optimized images.
The final GitHub Actions workflow file and Next.js config are at the end.
